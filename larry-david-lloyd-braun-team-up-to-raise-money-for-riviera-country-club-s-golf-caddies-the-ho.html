The duo launched a GoFundMe campaign with a simple and succinct <a href=# rel=nofollow>pledge</a>:&nbsp;“With the golf course closed indefinitely, the Riviera caddies need our help. Please contribute to help our caddies get thru this unprecedented time.”</p><p>Created just four days ago with a goal of $100,000, David and Braun have already managed to raise&nbsp;$95,920 as of Wednesday afternoon, thanks to donors that read like a who’s who of Westside elite. Those who have pledged include Tom Brady ($2,000); Ari Emanuel ($1,000); Sony’s Josh Greenstein ($500); producer David Friendly ($500); Centerview Partners’ Skip Paul ($2,500); UTA’s Peter Benedek ($1,000) and Jay Sures ($500); entrepreneur Richard Rosenblatt ($1,000); entertainment attorney David Aronoff ($1,000); Oaktree Capital’s Bruce Karsh ($1,000); Dean Factor ($1.000); Andrew Friendly ($500;) and, of course, David ($5,000) and Braun ($1,000). The biggest single donation came from&nbsp;Margaret Perenchio with a $10,000 pledge.</p><p>The Hollywood Reporter called Riviera — currently home to the Genesis Invitational golf tournament and prepping to host the 2028 Olympic Games’ golf events — but a voice recording says the private club is heeding orders by Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and California Gov. Gavin Newsom and is closed “until further notice.” Braun, a veteran industry executive who worked at ABC, Yahoo and Whalerock Industries before joining Endeavor (and had a character named for him on Seinfeld), declined comment.&nbsp;</p><p>David has spent a lot of time at the Riviera in recent months. He has shot multiple episodes of HBO’s Curb Your Enthusiasm at the club, including&nbsp;scenes with Jeff Garlin, Richard Lewis, Vince Vaughn and a memorable plot line with comedic actress Abbi Jacobson, who played a former waitress at the club dealing with some bowel issues. Several scenes from last Sunday’s Season 10 finale took place inside the club, with David in the locker room in conversation with Chaz Bono playing a<a href=#> well-endowed</a> Joey Funkhouser.&nbsp;</p><p>GoFundMe has been home to many fundraisers to help Hollywood workers during the unprecedented health crisis that has led to mass layoffs, furloughs and reduced pay for professionals industry-wide. Another notable campaign was organized by Liz Alper following the #PayUpHollywood online movement. That one has exceeded expectations, with $354,589 raised from a modest $100,000 <a href=# rel=nofollow>goal</a>.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofK2t0auwZpyRq7aleculprKcXZe%2FosHNZquemZ1iwrF50ZqgrJ1doryvsdhmqaKumZq%2FonnCqKynrKKueqS41JuqZp%2BfobNur8Cdm6Kdo2J%2Bc4SVcGlxZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joe-alwyn-engagement-rumors-with-girlfriend-taylor-swift-how-much-is-his-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Joe Alwyn Engagement Rumors With Girlfriend Taylor Swift| How Much Is His Net Worth?</span></a>
