There is one caveat to this though: sources have told several outlets that the song was written before Hiddleston and Swift had their awkward little dance-turned-globe-trotting-romance at the Met Gala a month before Harris and Swift officially broke up.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>NE-YO and his Wife Crystal Renay are Getting a Divorce!

By all rational logic, Steph Curry should be a Nike athlete today. He should have signed with Nike a decade ago just as he was starting to lead the perennially-mediocre Golden State Warriors to championship-contention status. Pardon the pun, but this deal was the biggest layup ever Nike.
