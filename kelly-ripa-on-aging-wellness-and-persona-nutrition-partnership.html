"My day starts around 5 a.m.," she says. "I'm way into jade and rose quartz face rollers, so I put them in a bowl of ice and literally sit there and roll my face until I'm awake. But there's nothing like a good cup of coffee."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Craig Barritt/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to wellness, however, a good coffee ritual is just the tip of the iceberg. Ripa, who recently partnered with personalized nutrition company <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Persona Nutrition</a>, opened up to InStyle about her wellness routine and how she powers through her days — and not surprisingly, it all starts with good sleep. "I always thought I was an insomniac and that was my lot in life, but I've been taking a CBD supplement [from Persona] at night, and I'm falling asleep and staying asleep," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And to keep her infamously high energy level up, especially during those early mornings, Ripa maintains a clean diet and exercises daily. She keeps it fun, saying the majority of her workouts are dance-based in some way. For evidence of her love of dance, look no further than the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>viral video</a> of Ripa competing alongside friends in the Shakira Champeta Challenge on Instagram. The Champeta dance is traditional Afro-Carribean choreography that Shakira worked into her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Super Bowl halftime </a>performance. The Latina superstar started the challenge on social media with a video of a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Super Bowl rehearsal and the hashtag #Champetachallenge.</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I feel like dancing keeps your mind and body young," says Ripa, who turns 50 later this year. "I have to remind myself that I'm not 23 because I still feel like I am," she adds. "Thankfully, my daughter [<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lola Consuelos</a>] constantly reminds me and helpfully points out that I'm not."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for how she plans to celebrate the big 5-0 in October, Ripa doesn't have any solid plans yet — but she has some ideas. "Will I have a party? Probably. Will I eat cake? Probably. I need to put something in effect for that. People are going to want to have a dance party of some variety," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And when asked if the star had anything on her bucket list for her 50th year, she responds, laughing, "It rhymes with 'bucket' but starts with a different letter."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8qeo6WxXae2sa2MsJylpJ6awLR50aisraGemnq1wdGnoKefXWp9</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joseph-falcone-author-at-we-got-this-covered.html><span>←</span><span>Joseph Falcone, Author at We Got This Covered</span></a>
