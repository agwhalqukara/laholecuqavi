We can’t wear what we want.

Tuesday marked the legislation’s first courtroom test.</p><p>Under the new Western Australian laws targeting outlaw motorcycle gangs, an offender can be jailed for up to a year and fined $12,000 for consorting or displaying the insignia of an identified organisation in a public place.</p><p>Gang tattoos and patches fall within the laws, with some members already seen publicly growing hair over or taping up tattoos.</p><p>The new laws also saw the introduction of what the WA Government itself labelled the “toughest anti-consorting regime in the country”.</p><p>Breaches carry a maximum penalty of five years in jail.</p><p>In late 2022, the heavy-handed laws were enough to unite warring gangs in solidarity against the rules. Mongols member Troy Mercanti, the first person in the state charged under the laws, kicked off a legal challenge to the High Court of Australia, represented by one of the state’s top barristers.</p><p><i><a class=body-link href=# title=www.watoday.com.au>WA Today</a></i> reported that the challenge would be bankrolled by WA gangs, with members asked to donate. It also reported that two summits with representatives from all clubs had already been held on the issue.</p><p>WA Premier Mark McGowan said the state was taking a zero-tolerance approach with introducing the new laws.</p><p>“This government is serious about stopping organised crime and protecting the community from the intimidation and violence carried out by bikie gangs,” he said.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>When quizzed on the<a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=cdf289d33a48af4b5cf5f56e3113c6a3 data-tgev-label=national data-tgev-metric=ev> technicalities of the insignia laws in 2021</a>, commissioner Blanch suggested “Band-Aids” or “makeup” to cover tattoos.</p><p>“‘I would start with things like Band-Aids or makeup certainly or have it removed, or alternatively, people can choose the option not to live in Western Australia if this law passes,’ he told 6PR’s Mornings Program.</p><p>“Young men are attracted to biker clubs because of the display of being an outlaw motorcycle gang to have the insignia on display as power, the display of numbers. It’s about breaking down that sort of culture and making sure that display of violence in the community is not tolerated and is not acceptable, and I think this thing sends a strong message to outlaw motorcycle gangs.”</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Perth data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Perth</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7zZqroqeelrlwr9GipJ5nnqR6rbvNoJyrZZyew6Z5yKdkmmWWp7KmecKorKesoq56o7XKopxmnaKqvbW%2FjJqdrZ2iYrSiusZmq5qspKS8bq%2FOp62im6SevK97zZ6urGWjqbyzxY5xapyeYW6xeYPCmmdub2iWhaR9lZ%2BdbW5gZ4Knf8OfZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./springfort-hall-country-house-hotel-review-county-cork-ireland.html><span>←</span><span>Springfort Hall Country House Hotel Review, County Cork, Ireland</span></a>
