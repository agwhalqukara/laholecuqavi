There was a time
When I was so brokenhearted
Love wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned - yeah
'Cause me and them ways have parted
That kinda love was the killin' kind
(so listen)All I want is someone I can't resist
I know - all I - need to know
By the way that I got kissed
I was Cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/46/>‚Üê Prev Page</a>
