I can see you lying if it’s life or death, or if it’s really going to be a detriment to your career or something, but he just makes up lies. I really feel sorry for him to be that type of person. I really feel sorry for him. I don’t know if that is fixable.<br>He has a lot more to prove in this sport. He’s got a lot more work to do to sit at the table with me. In the game right now — he is a child and I am a man, when you really think about it. Just when it comes to the things I’ve proven. He is not close to being on my level.</p><p><br>Jones has been very active on social media as of late, with feuds brewing with Chael Sonnen and Daniel Cormier in addition to this issue with Colby Covington.<br>Many fans are split down the middle in regards to Jones returning to the cage, whereas with Covington, it seems as if he’s poised to challenge the winner of this weekend’s Woodley/Till fight for the UFC Welterweight Championship.</p><p>September 7, 2018 8:59 am</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX55e49yZmlvX5%2B8r3nJqKWeq12owbO7zaBksKeimcBur86lmbJlk6TDqrrGraanZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./episodes-left-general-hospital.html><span>←</span><span>Episodes Left - General Hospital</span></a>
