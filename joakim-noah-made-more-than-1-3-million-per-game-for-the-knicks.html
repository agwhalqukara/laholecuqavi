However, the Knicks will also lose $6.4 million in cap space in 2020 and 2021.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Noah missed time due to a knee injury and received a suspension after taking a banned substance and had been separated from the team since February. He and Knicks coach <a href=# title="Jeff Hornacek Net Worth">Jeff Hornacek</a> often butted heads and even had to be physically separated during practice.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The verbal altercation with Hornacek proved to be the final straw. Noah only played in seven games last season, averaging career lows in minutes, points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The New York Post called the Noah deal the worst in franchise history.
