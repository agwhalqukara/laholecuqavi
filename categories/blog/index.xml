I’m assuming it’s 10/2 with ground? It is OK to use a wire that is somewhat bigger than necessary for safety reasons. Mechanically, a #10 should fit in the breaker just fine (check the breaker’s specifications), however it may not fit in the GFCI.
As a result, is it permissible to utilise 10 gauge wire for outlets? Wire Gauge for 240-Volt Electrical Outlets Because of voltage drop, 10-gauge wire is the minimum wire size for a 30-amp 240-volt circuit, but you should consider upgrading to 8-gauge if the outlet is located far enough from the panel to avoid poor performance as a result of voltage drop.</description></item><item><title>Christopher Mcdonald Net Worth 2024</title><link>/christopher-mcdonald-net-worth-2024.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/christopher-mcdonald-net-worth-2024.html</guid><description>To provide the best experiences, we use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.
