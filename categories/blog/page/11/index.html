<a href=../../../../can-you-use-10-2-wire-outlet.html></a>
Answer
I’m assuming it’s 10/2 with ground? It is OK to use a wire that is somewhat bigger than necessary for safety reasons. Mechanically, a #10 should fit in the breaker just fine (check the breaker’s specifications), however it may not fit in the GFCI.
As a result, is it permissible to utilise 10 gauge wire for outlets? Wire Gauge for 240-Volt Electrical Outlets Because of voltage drop, 10-gauge wire is the minimum wire size for a 30-amp 240-volt circuit, but you should consider upgrading to 8-gauge if the outlet is located far enough from the panel to avoid poor performance as a result of voltage drop.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Christopher Mcdonald Net Worth 2024</h2><time>Sep 14, 2024</time>
