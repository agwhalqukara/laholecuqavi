The fans are wondering if the superstar will make his return to the Kpop scene.</span></p><p><span>Lu Han, from his Instagram, hinted that he might make his comeback into Kpop. On 7 January 2021, the former EXO member shared his photo using a caption, '<strong>see you soon.'</strong></span></p><p><span>EXO, who made its debut with SM Entertainment in 2011 with 12 members, has enjoyed a smooth ascension to stardom. The band has collected more than 50 awards in the previous three years, including the 'Best Newcomer and Song Of The Year,' as per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>asiaone.com</a>.</span></p><p><span>The boy-band picked up tremendous fame worldwide with their appealing tracks, smooth dance moves, and dashing looks. When they operated as an 11-member group at the Singapore Indoor Stadium in August for their first solo concert at 'EXO Planet #1,' they sold out 8,000 seats.</span></p><p><span>EXO includes two sub-groups: EXO-M, who sings in Mandarin, and EXO-K, who sings in Korean. The former EXO member Lu Han was a member of EXO-M, alongside Kris, Tao, Chen, and Xiumin.</span></p><p><span>The band became inactive after Kris, Tao, and Lu Han left the industry.</span></p><p><span>Find more about Lu Han below.</span></p><h2><span><strong>Why Did Lu Han Leave EXO And SM Entertainment?</strong></span></h2><p><span>In 2014, EXO's Chinese members Lu Han and Kris filed a lawsuit against SM Entertainment's chief executive Lee Young, demanding that his exclusive contract with the agency be nullified, as per <a href=# rel=noopener>kpopbehind.com.</a>&nbsp;Afterward, Lu Han left the band in 2016.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, in 2015, another EXO member, Tao, chose to leave the agency after filing the same lawsuit against SM Entertainment. They sued a lawsuit against SM regarding issues with the Chinese member's contracts being excessively long.</span></p><p><span>After suing lawsuits against SM, the members of EXO said:</span></p><p><span><strong>"SM didn't regard us by any stretch of the imagination. SM has dealt with us like subjects of control and decided our timetables singularly. Also, we had financial challenges despite much work."</strong></span></p><p><span>In addition to the statement above, the members stated that&nbsp;<strong>'It is a working environment where it feels like we are robots in a factory.'</strong></span></p><p><span>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>koreaherald.com</a>, SM Entertainment also released an official statement towards Lu Han, stating:</span></p><p><strong><span>"He has no reason to file a lawsuit as was the case with Kris. It is likely that, upon gaining immense popularity through (EXO), he is putting his own good ahead of the group activities and those who are engaged in the contract."</span></strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbiz.com/images/Trending/2.jpg alt="Lu Han" width=650 height=812 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span><strong>Former EXO member Lu Han (©: Instagram/Lu Han)</strong></span></p><p><span>Before the court filing, SM Entertainment said that Lu Han has generally been missing from the entertainment scene due to medical issues. He even refused to participate in the exclusive concert held in Bangkok, Thailand, on 13 and 14 September (2020), due to headaches.</span></p><p><span>From his career as a K-Pop superstar, Lu Han has managed to garner a net worth of $10 million as of 2021, <a href=# rel=noopener>celebritynetworth.com</a> reports.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunDA0Z6lnaGenHytwYyhmKdlnZa4qrrGZpqopZWXrqS3jKRkqaegYrK5uw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tobi-lerone-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Tobi Lerone Net Worth</span></a>
