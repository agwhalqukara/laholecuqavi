In fact, Lizzo lived in her car for around six months until her wealth skyrocketed to seven figures.</p><p>Thanks to her Grammy and 2022 Emmy wins, her sound business judgement has now transcended the studio and the stage and is halfway to an EGOT. Lizzo has expanded her acting career by starring in her own TV reality series, working on advertising and marketing campaigns with major international brands, and yes, even dabbling in upscale real estate. What is known about Lizzo’s net worth and how she acquired it is listed below.</p><h3>What is Lizzo’s net worth?</h3><p>Her net worth is estimated at $10 million by the website Wealthy Gorilla and at $12 million by Celebrity Net Worth.</p><h3>How did Lizzo get famous?</h3><p>Lizzo wasn’t an overnight triumph; she was reared in Houston but was born in Detroit. She spent years polishing her artistic abilities (and flute playing!) in the Minneapolis music scene. The city’s most well-known singer, Prince, even gave her a boost by inviting her to record at Paisley Park, his renowned studio/home compound. On the Purple One’s 2014 album Plectrum­electrum, Lizzo made an appearance.</p><p>She even admitted to NPR in June 2019 that her time spent working with Prince not only compensated, but also resulted in “my first large check ever.” (What did she purchase with it? Rent for three months and a laptop.)</p><p>Work on Prince’s album, she added to Rolling Stone, “gave me confidence to be an artist, not simply a rapper or a singer or a girl in a band.” “Artists are immortal,” someone once said. Working with Prince also provided her with valuable career advice, she continued: “As an artist, your career is not dictated by trends or age. The main thing Prince taught me was to spread positivism and the fact that art endures forever. Be enduring.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u92ffa75ced90d7c16713fa1bd657f284><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Cardi B Throws Mic in Epic Stage Moment: Watch the Viral Video!</span></a><h3>How much does Lizzo make a year?</h3><p>Since musicians have so many different revenue streams, including songwriting royalties, payments from streaming services, merchandising, sales, touring, promotions, and more, calculating their yearly incomes can be challenging. Although the pandemic has prevented her from touring, her previous stint on the road was successful. The Cuz I Love You Too tour visited North America, England, Europe, and Australia from July 2019 to January 2020. Rates for the Hollywood Palladium’s tickets ranged from $89.50 to $99.50, while in Charlotte, prices for an amphitheatre tour varied from $39 to $79. Over the course of a tour, that represents a respectable wage.</p><h3>How many albums did Lizzo sell?</h3><p>Lizzo has sold a respectable amount of music, including both singles and albums. Early in 2020, Cuz I Love You received platinum certification (for one million sales), while Truth Hurts went seven times platinum, Good As Hell went four times platinum, and Juice got double platinum. That just includes domestic sales and streaming data; it does not account for her overseas sales or streaming figures.</p><h3>How much does Lizzo make for endorsements?</h3><p>Celebrities can make a large sum of money from endorsements. Lizzo has chosen to work with brands and goods that make sense for her and has been wise about her endorsements. In 2019, she sang (what else?) her song “Juice” in advertisements for Absolut Vodka’s Absolut Juice.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
