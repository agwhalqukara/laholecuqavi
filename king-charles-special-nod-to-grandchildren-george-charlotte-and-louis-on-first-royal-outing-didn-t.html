"He brought out his fossil collection and showed the children that, which, I think, George at the time absolutely adored - he's got loads of dinosaur fossils."&nbsp;</p><p id=eAL0zPsNGz data-wc=51>Prince Louis also has a particular penchant for dinosaurs, and when he was four, the young royal enjoyed a fun day out with his Nanny, Maria Borrallo, at the Natural History Museum. One of the museum's most popular exhibits is a large animatronic T.Rex, which may have inspired King Charles' tie.</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">LOVE THE ROYALS?
