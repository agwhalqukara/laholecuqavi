Yes, the version of you in the Cable cosplay might not be lying as the latest word the street claims that the Australian icon is indeed eager to return after this summer’s X-Men-themed blockbuster, and you can probably guess what film it could happen in. Although the supposed instructions Jackman has given Marvel about this project may just surprise you.</p><h2 id=h-hugh-jackman-has-allegedly-put-in-a-very-specific-request-for-an-avengers-secret-wars-cameo data-injectable=false>Hugh Jackman has allegedly put in a very specific request for an Avengers: Secret Wars cameo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/x-men-days-of-future-past-wolverine-hugh-jackman-1.jpg><p data-characters=502 data-current-count=802 data-injectable=true>As per scooper <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MyTimeToShineHello</a>, Jackman has allegedly told Marvel Studios that he is ready to portray Wolverine again in Avengers: Secret Wars, the grand finale to the MCU’s Multiverse Saga that’s scheduled for May 2027, but he has two specific conditions that would have to be met for him to sign along the dotted line. Now, this is just an unsubstantiated rumor for now, but these two conditions are so thrilling that many will be praying there’s some truth to this scuttlebutt.</p><p data-characters=621 data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true>Apparently, Jackman will only do a Secret Wars cameo if he gets to team up with two fellow Marvel legends that he’s never shared the screen with to date. They are Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man and Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man. Luckily for Hugh, the first one could be very easily arranged. Like Jackman, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Maguire has long been rumored for a Secret Wars role</a>, and given his own comeback in Spider-Man: No Way Home it certainly feels highly plausible. Unfortunately, Downey seems to have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">split from franchise films for now</a>, with his Oppenheimer awards success making a superhero cinema comeback seem unlikely.</p><p data-characters=656 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=false>If you don’t believe that Jackman’s enough of a Marvel nerd to care about working with Spider-Man and Iron Man, then you may not have been paying enough attention: the guy’s been talking about how much <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he would love his Logan to meet the Avengers since 2014</a>. Plus, a Wolverine cameo in 2002’s Spider-Man was planned, and apparently only cancelled <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">because his costume was unavailable on the day</a>. Again, this is all unconfirmed right now, but Jackman’s eagerness to return and fanboy conditions do seem very him. And, I’m just saying, don’t forget <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that Secret Wars Easter egg in the Deadpool & Wolverine trailer</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon66fmGK3oq%2FKppinq12jsrnAjKaarmWdpMOqsYyana2domKxpq3DqaaopF1oeq61xqGrZpmcp7KisNhmmZ5lmaN6tbTEZpman12ovG64zqeeZpmjYrqivtWeo2allZrBtHnHoqpmal2YvK%2BwyK2gqKajZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hailey-baldwin-picture-stephen-baldwin-s-daughter-at-movie-premiere.html><span>←</span><span>Hailey Baldwin Picture: Stephen Baldwin's Daughter at Movie Premiere</span></a>
