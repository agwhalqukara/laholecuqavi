Prior to this, he played with Pa√ßos de Ferreira, Atl√©tico Madrid, FC Porto, and the Wolverhampton Wanderers. On the global stage, Jota has represented Portugal in the UEFA Nations League and UEFA Euro.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Diogo Jota was born as Diogo Jos√© Teixeira da Silva on December 4, 1996 in the Massarelos area of Porto, Portugal.</p><h2 id=pacos-de-ferreira><strong>Pa√ßos de Ferreira</strong></h2><p>Jota began his club career with the youth setup of Pa√ßos de Ferreira in 2013. Subsequently, at the beginning of the 2014-15 season, he was promoted to the club's main squad. Jota made his senior debut by starting in a 4-0 home victory over Atl√©tico de Reguengos. He went on to make his first Primeira Liga appearance in early 2015 as a substitute for Diogo Rosado in a 2-2 home tie with Vit√≥ria de GuimarƒÅes. A few months later, Jota signed a new five-year contract with Pa√ßos.</p><h2 id=atletico-madrid-fc-porto><strong>Atl√©tico Madrid and FC Porto</strong></h2><p>In March of 2016, Jota signed a five-year contract with the La Liga club Atl√©tico Madrid. Later, in August, he returned to Portugal to join FC Porto on a one-year loan. In October, Jota recorded a hat-trick in a 4-0 win against Nacional. He went on to participate in the 2016-17 UEFA Champions League, scoring his first competition goal in a 5-0 victory over Leicester City.</p><h2 id=wolverhampton-wanderers><strong>Wolverhampton Wanderers</strong></h2><p>Jota joined the English Championship club Wolverhampton Wanderers on a season loan in the summer of 2017. With the club, he scored his first goal in a 3-2 victory over Hull City. In early 2018, it was reported that Jota had made a deal to remain with Wolverhampton. During his first year, he scored a career-best 17 league goals as the club was promoted to the Premier Leagues. Jota subsequently made his debut in the English top division in a 2-2 home tie with Everton. In late 2018, he recorded his first competition goal in a 2-1 win over Chelsea. A little over a month later, in early 2019, Jota notched his second career hat-trick in a 4-3 win over Leicester City. He recorded another major accomplishment a couple months later with his winning goal against Manchester United in the FA Cup; in the process, the Wolves advanced to their first semifinal in that competition since 1997-98.</p><p>The 2019-20 season was Jota's final with the Wolves. In July, he helped the club win over the Crusaders in the Europa League second qualifying round; this was the Wolves' first European goal since 1980. The Wolves ultimately reached the final Europa League group stage, during which Jota came on as a substitute and completed a hat-trick to give his team the win. He scored another hat-trick in the first leg of the tournament's last 32. Jota made his final Wolves appearance as a second-half substitute in the Europa League quarterfinal against Sevilla.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-331559 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Diogo-Jota.jpg alt="Diogo Jota Net Worth" width=900 height=623 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-331559 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Clive Brunskill/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=liverpool><strong>Liverpool</strong></h2><p>In September of 2020, Jota signed to Liverpool.

In October, he scored the winning goal against Sheffield United; just three days after that, he scored Liverpool's 10,000th goal. Jota continued his success in November, scoring a hat-trick in a 5-0 victory over Atalanta. However, his season came to a halt in December when he weathered a leg injury during a UEFA Champions League match; he was consequently sidelined for three months. Jota finished his debut season with Liverpool with nine league goals, helping the club finish third in the Premier League.</p><p>In 2021-22, Jota scored Liverpool's first goal of the Premier League season in a 3-0 win over Norwich City.

In early 2022, Jota scored both goals in Liverpool's 2-0 victory over Arsenal in the second leg of the league cup semifinals. In the subsequent final against Chelsea, he helped Liverpool win its first league cup in a decade.</p><h2 id=international-playing><strong>International Playing</strong></h2><p>On the international stage, Jota began playing for the Portugal national team at the under-19 level. In May of 2015, he scored his first goal in a 6-1 victory over Turkey. Later that year, he won his first cap for the under-21 team in a 3-0 win against Israel.</p><p>Jota was called up as a senior in March of 2019. In June, he was part of the squad that won the UEFA Nations League Finals, although he didn't make an appearance on the field. He finally made his debut in November as a substitute for <a href=# title="Cristiano Ronaldo Net Worth">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> in a 6-0 routing of Lithuania in a UEFA Euro qualifier. The next year, Jota scored his first international goal in a 4-1 home victory over Croatia in the UEFA Nations League. In the delayed UEFA Euro 2020 tournament, Jota appeared in all of Portugal's games leading up to the team's round of 16 loss to Belgium.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Jota is in a longterm relationship with Rute Cardoso, with whom he had a son named Dinis in 2021.</p><p>A serious gamer, Jota maintains his own eSports team called Diogo Jota eSports.
