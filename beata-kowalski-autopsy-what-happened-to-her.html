She was born in Poland and worked her way through nursing school after coming to the U.S. The doctor told Maya that she needed to take ketamine every day to treat her breathing and pain in different parts of her body.</p><p><strong>In 2016, Maya’s symptoms came back, this time they were very bad stomach pain.</strong> She was taken to Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital to get help. When they got there, the amount of ketamine in Maya’s body seemed to worry the doctors, who even called her a “ketamine girl” in text messages.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Beata-and-Maya.jpg><p>Doctors wanted to stop the treatment, but Beata demanded they keep going. This made the doctors suspicious. Because of this and the fact that Beata seemed pushy, the doctors called in a social worker, who finally said that <strong>Beata had “mental issues.”</strong></p><p>A doctor named Sally Smith was brought in to look into the case. She said that Beata had Munchausen by proxy, which means she was making Maya sick on purpose. Maya was taken into state care and didn’t get to see her parents very often.</p><p>It was only three months before Beata was found guilty of knowingly making her daughter sick. <strong>In January 2017, Beata killed herself in her garage and her autopsy report is not yet revealed officially. </strong>For more information related to this, you can see the documentary “Take Care of Maya” <a href=# rel=noopener>on Netflix</a>.</p><p><strong>Below we provided our latest posts related to other persons’ autopsy reports:</strong></p><h2>For Whom Did Kowalski’s Sue After Beata’s Death?</h2><p><strong>The Kowalski family sued All Children’s Hospital after Beata’s death, which happened just days after a judge said the mother should stay away from her daughter.</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>The Kowalskis are suing Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital for millions in a case depicted in the Netflix documentary “Take Care of Maya.” <a href=#>https://t.co/bbAEPn2hMr</a></p><p>— Court TV (@CourtTV) <a href=# rel=noopener>October 26, 2023</a></p><p>The claim says that Beata’s death was caused by false accusations of abuse. The case was supposed to start in 2019, but the hospital filed an appeal, so it won’t start until September 2023.</p><p>She died, but Beata’s voice is still heard in Take Care of Maya. <strong>Maya was able to go back to her father after Beata died.</strong> The makers still wanted to tell their story even though the case hadn’t been decided yet. Producer Caroline Keating says:</p><p>“At a certain point, you have to stop filming, But this is their truth, that the trial hasn’t happened yet. And we think that’s important to show that they are still fighting.”</p><p>You can <a href=# rel=noopener>follow us on Twitter</a> for more information related to these kinds of topics.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdhZnxxf46bnJqskWK4sMPApaqkoV2WwrW7z6ywaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-orbeez-challenge-on-tiktok-police-warns-kids-shooting-gel-pun-pellets-of-possible-arrest.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Orbeez Challenge On TikTok?
