One of his sons decides to buy an exotic car without telling his father, and all of the Sanders kids are getting a bit relaxed in terms of chores and housekeeping. “It’s getting on my nerves,” says Deion.</p><p>It was during the first season of ‘Family Playbook’ that we watched <a href=#>Deion receive counsel from Snoop Dogg</a>. Sanders was telling the rapper about his older son, Shilo, who had no desire to follow in his father’s footsteps at the time. “You know it hurts you as a father that they’re not going down the path that you want,” said Deion. Snoop Dogg gave him words of comfort and advised the former NFL player to “let [Shilo] walk his own path. You’ve got to let him go into uncharted territory.”</p><p>The kids are definitely going into uncharted territory this season with wild spending habits and unkempt rooms. Check out a snippet from the show below. You can also catch the latest&nbsp;episode of ‘Deion’s Family Playbook’ on OWN this Saturday.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kG5maW1fZ31wwNVmrpqsk516pbHIqKWsZZaWuqq42GanpZmpl7ywt4yiqmaakZi4brvNZqawpl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./oliver-tree-net-worth-age-wiki-biography-relationship-wife-dating-ethnicity-height-fact.html><span>←</span><span>Oliver Tree Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Biography, Relationship, Wife, Dating, Ethnicity,Height&amp;amp;Fact</span></a>
