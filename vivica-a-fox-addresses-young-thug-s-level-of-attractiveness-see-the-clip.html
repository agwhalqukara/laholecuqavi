Woman or man its messed up & it’s not funny at all.’</p><p>A follower posted this message: ‘He’s going to go in on her, and I don’t want to see folks saying he took it too far bc what she said is awful.’</p><p>A commenter said: ‘Oh well. She said what she said! Black men are saying the same about dark skin black women.’</p><p>Someone else posted this: ‘Heavy on the roach with blonde dreads😭’</p><p>A commenter said: ‘But let the rolls reverse and everyone would call him a colourist she dead wrong for that,’ and someone else posted this message: ‘Sorry but if a black man or ANY non-black person said this about dark-skinned black women, all hell would break loose! 😏 Stop comparing people to animals, insects, etc.’</p><p>Not too long ago, in relation to Kenya Moore.</p><p>It’s been revealed that Vivica brought up Kenya on her Fox Soul show earlier this year by saying that that’s a feud that will never go away.</p><p>In a surprising move, Kenya apologized to Vivica on the Wendy Williams Show.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘And as a woman hearing that, it really broke my heart because I do have a love for Vivica even though we beef.&nbsp; To me, it was superficial.
