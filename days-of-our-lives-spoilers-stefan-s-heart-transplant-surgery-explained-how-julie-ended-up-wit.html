Once Jake gets the results of his DNA results back, he’ll be truly stunned by what they say. Since Jake has repeatedly dismissed the idea that he’s Stefan, his stunned reaction suggests his DNA will be a match.</p><p>Of course, that leaves fans with an important question. If this is the real Stefan, how is he alive – especially when he supposedly gave his heart to Julie Williams (Susan Seaforth Hayes)? Let’s think about Stefan’s heart transplant surgery for a moment.</p><p>Here are the facts that the show presented. A man who looks exactly like Stefan had his heart removed – and Sarah Horton (Linsey Godfrey) was part of this procedure. Sarah was pretty torn up about the whole thing after it was over. It was an emotional day in the operating room, but the point is Sarah can confirm nothing seemed out of the ordinary.</p><p>“I was here when they brought Stefan in with the gunshot wound, and I was a part of the team that removed his heart after Gabi agreed to donate it to Julie,” Sarah said to Eric Brady (Greg Vaughan) on October 15, 2019. “I was in surgery for hours, and now Kayla and her team are in the process of transplanting the heart in Julie.”</p><p>There’s been a theory that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Henry Shah’s (Piter Marek) heart might’ve actually gone to Stefan</a>, but Days would have to overcome some major hurdles with that option. For starters, Dr. Shah was already dead before Stefan ever got shot. Plus, Dr. Shah’s chest area was a bloody mess after Jack Deveraux (Matthew Ashford) stabbed him.</p><p>What Sarah saw was a man who looked like Stefan and had injuries consistent with what happened in the park – which involved Stefan getting shot in the throat.</p><p>Dr. Shah’s different injuries would’ve raised red flags, so Days would’ve had to change them through DiMera doctor magic. Henry also would’ve had to have been wearing a Stefan mask to look like him.</p><p>It just seems like a lot of trouble to explain when there could just as easily be a Stefan lookalike involved – namely the real Jake Lambert. So was Jake perhaps swapped in for this surgery?</p><p>Did someone nefarious shoot Jake in the same manner and make sure he was on that operating table instead? We wouldn’t put it past a DOOL villain!</p><p>Back when Days of Our Lives rewrote the story where Aiden Jennings (Daniel Cosgrove) tried to kill Hope Brady (Kristian Alfonso), it was explained that Andre DiMera (Thaao Penghlis) brought in a lookalike and swapped him in at the last second.</p><p>That Aiden lookalike was ultimately killed by Bo Brady (Peter Reckell), which led to the real Aiden resurfacing eventually.</p><p>Days may take a similar route here by showing us a last-minute switch, which put the real Jake in the OR instead of Stefan. It doesn’t seem like DOOL’s style to have all this buildup to Stefan and not do a big survival twist – like when Will Horton (Chandler Massey), EJ DiMera (James Scott) and so many others miraculously survived.</p><p>Then again, no one can rule out Jake being Stefan’s identical twin who’s alive and well. The DNA test would bring the same results either way, but there have been plenty of hints about Jake actually being Stefan DiMera – like Gabi sensing his presence and that tiny part of Jake that’s wondered if she could be right.</p><p>The story’s been set up for “Jake” to be revealed as Stefan, so we’ll see if that’s how it plays out. As other DOOL news becomes available, we’ll bring you more updates. Days of Our Lives spoilers say some intriguing Stefan details are coming up, so keep watching!
