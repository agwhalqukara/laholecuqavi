(You can <a href=#>read the PDF on TMZ</a>) The details are sordid, but more than that they’re just sad. Reading and thinking about it made my heart sink. There were prescription bottles and drugs found all over the room, with a total of 12 prescription drugs entered into evidence. Cops found evidence of illegal drug use including “a small spoon with a white crystal like substance in it” and “remnants of a white powdery substance” in a drawer with a portable mirror in it. This suggests that the room was not wiped clean of evidence at all. Earlier reports claiming a shady hanger-on named Raffles Von Exel <a href=#>removed evidence from the scene</a> are <a href=#>not being taken seriously by police</a>. (<a href=#>Von Exel denies</a> giving an interview in which he allegedly admitted removing evidence.)</p><p>The detail in this report that stood out for me is the fact that Whitney died alone in the bathtub after her assistant stepped out to run an errand. The assistant found her face down in the bathtub when she returned and no one else was in the room. For some reason I got the impression that there was a group of people partying with her – there wasn’t. It was just Whitney. Officials have ruled Whitney’s death an accident, and there was no evidence of foul play. Whitney did have some small abrasions on her forehead, nose and chest, suggesting that she either fell or slid in the bathtub. (They didn’t conclude that, it’s something I’m guessing.) They also noted that she had a hole in her septum from years of cocaine use. I wasn’t a huge Whitney Houston fan, but reading this is making me get teary. I know she was an addict but it’s still very, very sad. Here’s more on the report, from Radar:</p><p>The full autopsy report has been released for Whitney Houston, and disturbing details are revealed in the forty-two page document, including there was a white substance found in the bathroom on a spoon, and that Whitney had a perforation in her posterior nasal septum, RadarOnline.com is reporting.</p><p>The report states that the last person to see Houston alive was her assistant, who told the singer to take a bath to get ready for Clive Davis’ pre-Grammys party. The assistant went to Neiman Marcus to run an errand and when she got back, the report states, “she went into the bathroom and found the decedent lying face down in the bathtub, unresponsive, with the top of her head facing west. The bathtub was filled with water and there was water on the bathroom floor, however, the water was not running. She called out to the bodyguard and they pulled the decedent out of the bathtub. The assistant then called downstairs telling them to call 911.”</p><p>Various prescription pill bottles were found in the living room and bedroom of the hotel suite but the bathroom was where the cocaine was found. “Located on the south portion of the counter was a small spoon with a white crystal substance in it and a rolled up piece of white paper, along with other miscellaneous items. Located in the top drawer in the north side of the counter were remnants of a white powdery substance and a portable mirror on a base. On the bottom of that base were more remnants of a white powdery substance.”</p><p>[From <a href=#>Radar</a>]</p><p>The report concluded that toxicology “showed cocaine, benzoylecgonice, cocaethylene, marijuana, Xanax, Flexiril, and Benadryl.” As <a href=#>was previously announced</a>, “Death was due to drowning due to effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use. No foul play is suspected. The mode of death is accident.”</p><p>I’m not going to include more, if you want the details <a href=#>you can read them on Radar</a>. I’m just going to hug everyone I love now.</p><p>Whitney’s mom, Cissy Houston, <a href=#>recently did an interview</a> in which she said she misses Whitney and would do anything she could to bring her back. She also said she doesn’t blame herself for Whitney’s death, and that there are a lot of people coming out of the woodwork now that she’s passed. As for Cissy’s reaction to this autopsy report, she’s <a href=#>said to be “devastated,”</a> especially because she doesn’t want people to remember her daughter as a drug addict.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/wenn3733035.jpg alt="Whitney Houston" title=wenn3733035 width=600 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/wenn3733040.jpg alt="Whitney Houston" title=wenn3733040 width=600 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/wenn5794811.jpg alt="Whitney Houston" title=wenn5794811 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/wenn3731640-696x1024.jpg alt="Whitney Houston" title=wenn3731640 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/wenn3731641-692x1024.jpg alt="Whitney Houston" title=wenn3731641 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/wenn5792819-719x1024.jpg alt="Whitney Houston" title=wenn5792819 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma2lpZoJ0e9ahoK2mla6sqbvUrKuopqOUrrbAzqmqspeimr2wvtOYqZ6klZbAprC%2BnKacmZmjsqB9kZipsZeSpMG1uMSslp%2BnpaOxoLvNmKqcnZ6afA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-nikolai-demidenko-net-worth-2024-wiki-age-weight-height-relationships-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>What is Nikolai Demidenko Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Age, Weight, Height, Relationships, And More</span></a>
