Ash by Elegance is Dana Brooke’s new name in TNA Wrestling. She broke her silence on the matter, where she only re-stated her name. Although she hasn’t had a chance to do anything in TNA yet, her new persona is getting dragged hard."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

She just keeps getting better and is doing the best work of her career right now. When Ash by Elegance showed up at TNA Wrestling Hard to Kill, even with a butler by her side, fans started to call her out for gimmick infringement.</p><p>In a tweet translated from Spanish, it said, “TNA signs Dana Brooke. It will be Ash by Elegance. It does not convince me. Brooke has never been much of a draw. It seems that they want to reissue the success of ‘Timeless’ Toni Storm.’TNA signs Dana Brooke. It will be Ash by Elegance. It does not convince me. Brooke has never been much of a draw. It seems that they want to reissue the success of ‘Timeless’ Toni Storm.”</p><p>Many tweets compared Dana Brooke’s new elegance character to Toni Storm’s Timeless gimmick. This was ripped on pretty hard by some as they jumped to conclusions after only one showing of Brooke at TNA Wrestling Hard to Kill.</p><p>“Discount Timeless Toni Storm makes TNA debut at Hard to Kill 2024”</p><p>Listen Dana I am glad you have work and hope you do well but don’t think we don’t notice the blatant gimmick infringement</p><p>Dana Brooke’s new character hasn’t had a chance to do anything on camera yet, except for appear in the crowd, and she is already being compared to Toni Storm. The tribalism in pro wrestling fans is real, and this new gimmick for Dana Brooke is getting prematurely judged pretty hard.</p><p>We will have to see what happens in this situation, because it’s really too early to say she’s ripping anyone off. In the meantime, fans are going to keep sharing their bold opinions, and you may find a few of them below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What’s your take on this situation with Dana Brooke’s new gimmick?
