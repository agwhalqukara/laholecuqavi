The Safdie brothers’ new thriller managed to score $1 million from just five screens, giving it an average of $46,496 per screen in comparison to $40,000 for Star Wars.</p><p>For the most part, the vast majority of indie theaters chose to stay away from releasing this weekend due to the insane competition from Disney, that way they could have a better chance of scoring solid ticket sales on Christmas Day.</p><p>Dabangg 3, a Hindi-language action-comedy, screened on 294 screens and earned $1.11 million for an average of $3,793 per screen. Movies such as A Hidden Life didn’t perform quite as well in its second weekend.</p><p>Reportedly, Terrence Malick’s new movie is three-hours long and tackles difficult content and themes, in other words, it’s not quite as marketable to large audiences. The movie earned only $250,000 from 106 screens and made $2,350 on average.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B6OA842l9VO/</p><p>As it was previously reported, Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker performed as expected this year, soaring to a $190 million approximately in its opening weekend, and making it one of the most commercially successful films this year.</p><p>However, thus far, the film has poor reviews from official film critics, although, the audience score tends to be better. Uncut Gems, on the other hand, is another critically acclaimed movie with Adam Sandler, who made a surprising revelation earlier this year.</p><p>During a conversation with Brad Pitt, the actor asked him whether or not it was true that Adam Sandler had a beer with the professor who told him he would be better off to quit acting and leave it behind. His acting professor told Sandler one evening that he “didn’t have it,” and it would be better to move on instead.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Sandler met him again in the future after catapulting to stardom, and rather than rubbing it in his face, Sandler reportedly introduced his professor to his friends by saying he was the only professor to ever buy him a beer.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGelo7C2wIygnKarXZi%2FsL%2FSnqpmaV2itq24yKilZqWRp7hurdNmoKecmZp6o7vXZqafnpmYsrR5km5qa2pnZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./madeleine-madden-net-worth-wiki-age-weight-and-height-relationships-family-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>Madeleine Madden Net Worth - Wiki, Age, Weight and Height, Relationships, Family, and More</span></a>
